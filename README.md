### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Design

You all can find the preview of the page in the Design folder, where you can guide yourself about how you want that your page looks like.

### Links

- Repository URL: https://github.com/Omared250/single-price-grid-component
- Live Site URL: https://single-price-grid-component-lime-two.vercel.app/

## My process

My first step was to build the project base by creating the folder that stores the css style, the folder that stores the images and create the html file. After this, 
I proceeded to create a local git repository to save the versions of my project. I link it with a remote github repository to be able to update my project on the web 
and then I started to configure my project at the html and css level.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about CSS Grid and i really like beacuse i could improve a little more my skills about CSS and HTML
